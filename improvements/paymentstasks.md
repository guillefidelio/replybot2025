### Notes

- This implementation integrates with the existing Chrome extension architecture
- All new services should follow the singleton pattern established in the codebase
- Firestore security rules must be thoroughly tested before deployment
- Cloud Functions require proper error handling and logging for production use
- Use `npm test` to run all tests or `npm test -- --testPathPattern=CreditService` for specific test files
- Paddle webhooks require HTTPS endpoints and signature verification
- Rate limiting is essential to prevent abuse of credit consumption endpoints
