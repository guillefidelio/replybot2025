# Product Requirements Document: AI Review Responder Chrome Extension

## Introduction/Overview

The AI Review Responder is a Chrome extension designed to help small business owners efficiently respond to Google My Business reviews using AI-generated responses. The extension addresses the time-consuming nature of manually crafting review responses and ensures consistent, professional response quality across all customer interactions.

**Problem Statement:** Small business owners spend significant time manually responding to customer reviews, often struggling with response consistency and quality while managing other business operations.

**Goal:** Create an intelligent Chrome extension that automates the review response process while maintaining personalized, professional communication with customers.

## Goals

1. **Time Savings:** Reduce review response time by 80% through AI automation
2. **Consistency:** Ensure all review responses maintain professional tone and brand voice
3. **Coverage:** Increase review response rate by making it effortless to respond to all reviews
4. **Customization:** Allow business owners to tailor AI responses to their specific business needs
5. **Trust & Control:** Provide multiple trust levels allowing users to maintain control over automated responses

## User Stories

**As a small business owner, I want to:**
- Quickly generate professional responses to customer reviews so that I can maintain customer engagement without spending hours writing responses
- Customize AI prompts for different review types so that responses feel authentic to my business
- Preview AI-generated responses before posting so that I can ensure quality and appropriateness
- Automatically respond to positive reviews in bulk so that I can focus on addressing negative feedback manually
- Set up rate-limited auto-responses so that my interactions appear natural to Google's systems

**As a busy restaurant owner, I want to:**
- Respond to all 4-5 star reviews automatically so that customers feel appreciated without requiring my constant attention
- Have different response templates for reviews mentioning specific aspects (food, service, atmosphere) so that responses feel personalized

## Functional Requirements

### Core Detection & Injection
1. The extension must detect when the user is on Google My Business review pages (`business.google.com/reviews` and `business.google.com/groups/*/reviews`)
2. The extension must inject "Respond with AI" buttons next to existing "responder" buttons for each individual review
3. The extension must identify unanswered reviews vs. already-responded reviews

### AI Response Generation
4. The extension must integrate with Gemini API to generate review responses
5. The extension must pass review content (star rating, text, reviewer name) to the AI for context-aware responses
6. The extension must allow sentiment analysis beyond star ratings through AI processing in prompts
7. The extension must generate responses that maintain professional tone and business-appropriate language

### Prompt Management System
8. The extension must provide a settings interface for creating, editing, and deleting custom prompts
9. The extension must support different prompts based on review score (1-star, 2-star, 3-star, 4-star, 5-star)
10. The extension must support different prompts for reviews with text vs. reviews without text
11. The extension must store all prompts locally in browser storage
12. The extension must provide default prompt templates for immediate usability

### Trust Modes & Response Options
13. The extension must offer a preview mode for individual reviews showing AI response before posting
14. The extension must offer a "trust mode" for individual reviews that posts responses directly without preview
15. The extension must provide "Positive Trust Mode" bulk processing (responds only to 4-5 star reviews)
16. The extension must provide "Full Trust Mode" bulk processing (responds to all unanswered reviews)
17. The extension must implement rate limiting of 10-15 seconds between automated responses
18. The extension must allow users to cancel bulk processing operations

### User Interface
19. The extension must use React with TypeScript for all UI components
20. The extension must use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
21. The extension must provide a popup interface for settings and prompt management
22. The extension must show processing indicators during AI response generation
23. The extension must display success/error notifications for response posting

### Data Management
24. The extension must store all settings and prompts in local browser storage
25. The extension must handle storage quota limits gracefully
26. The extension must provide data export/import functionality for prompt backup

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Multi-Platform Support:** Will not support review platforms other than Google My Business in initial version
2. **Analytics & Reporting:** Will not include response rate tracking, sentiment analytics, or performance dashboards
3. **Cloud Synchronization:** Will not sync data across devices (planned for future version with Google auth)
4. **Business Management Integration:** Will not integrate with existing CRM or business management tools
5. **Multiple Business Types:** Will not support different prompt templates for different business categories
6. **Advanced Scheduling:** Will not include features to schedule responses for specific times
7. **Team Collaboration:** Will not support multiple users or role-based permissions

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite for development and building
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **AI Service:** Gemini API for response generation
- **Storage:** Chrome Extension Storage API (local)

### Chrome Extension Architecture
- **Manifest V3** compliance required
- **Content Scripts** for injecting UI elements into Google My Business pages
- **Background Script** for API communications and data processing
- **Popup Interface** for settings and prompt management

### API Integration
- Secure API key storage using Chrome Extension storage
- Error handling for API failures and rate limits
- Fallback mechanisms when AI service is unavailable

### Future Technical Pipeline
- Google Authentication integration for cloud sync
- Migration path from local storage to cloud storage
- Multi-device synchronization capability

## Design Considerations

### User Experience
- Buttons should match Google My Business interface design patterns
- Loading states must be clearly indicated during AI processing
- Error messages should be user-friendly and actionable
- Settings interface should be intuitive for non-technical users

### Performance
- Minimize impact on Google My Business page load times
- Efficient DOM manipulation for button injection
- Optimized API calls to reduce latency

## Success Metrics

1. **Time Savings:** Measure average time from review detection to response posting (target: under 30 seconds per review)
2. **User Adoption:** Track percentage of detected reviews that receive AI-generated responses
3. **Response Consistency:** Ensure 95%+ of generated responses maintain professional quality standards
4. **Error Rate:** Maintain less than 5% failure rate in response generation and posting
5. **User Satisfaction:** Post-implementation survey showing 80%+ user satisfaction with time savings

## Open Questions

1. **Review Detection Edge Cases:** How should the extension handle reviews in different languages or with special characters?
2. **Google My Business UI Changes:** What contingency plans are needed if Google updates their interface?
3. **API Rate Limiting:** What backup strategies should be implemented if Gemini API hits rate limits?
4. **Prompt Quality Assurance:** Should there be built-in prompt validation to prevent inappropriate responses?
5. **Privacy Considerations:** What review data should be logged for debugging vs. privacy protection?
6. **Browser Compatibility:** Beyond Chrome, should we plan for Edge/Firefox compatibility?
