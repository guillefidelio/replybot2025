### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- Chrome extension content scripts and background scripts require special consideration for testing due to browser API dependencies.

  Got it. Here is the implementation plan with the task numbering starting from 5.

[x] 5.0 Backend: Secure OpenAI API Proxy üîê
  [x] 5.1 Set Up Google Cloud Environment
    [x] 5.1.1 Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console.
    [x] 5.1.2 Enable the Cloud Functions API, Cloud Build API, and Secret Manager API for your project.
    [x] 5.1.3 Install and initialize the gcloud command-line tool on your local machine.
    [x] 5.1.4 Authenticate the gcloud CLI with your Google Cloud account using gcloud auth login.
  [x] 5.2 Create and Secure the API Key
    [x] 5.2.1 In the Secret Manager, create a new secret named openai-api-key.
    [x] 5.2.2 Add a new version to the secret with your actual OpenAI API key as the value.
    [x] 5.2.3 Note the full resource ID of the secret for later use.
  [x] 5.3 Develop the Cloud Function
    [x] 5.3.1 Create a new directory for your function (e.g., openai-proxy-function).
    [x] 5.3.2 Inside the directory, create a package.json file specifying a Node.js runtime and any dependencies (like @google-cloud/secret-manager).
    [x] 5.3.3 Create an index.js file for the function's code.
    [x] 5.3.4 Write the Node.js function to:
        Accept a POST request containing the user's prompt.
        Fetch the OpenAI API key from Secret Manager at runtime.
        Make a fetch call to the OpenAI API, forwarding the prompt and attaching the API key.
        Return OpenAI's response back to the caller (the Chrome extension).
    [x] 5.3.5 Implement CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in the function's response headers to allow requests from your Chrome extension's ID (chrome-extension://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID).
  [x] 5.4 Deploy and Test the Cloud Function
    [x] 5.4.1 Deploy the function using the gcloud functions deploy command, specifying Node.js as the runtime, allowing unauthenticated invocations, and passing the secret as an environment variable.
    [x] 5.4.2 Once deployed, test the function's trigger URL using a tool like Postman or curl to ensure it correctly proxies requests.


[x] 6.0 Frontend: Chrome Extension Integration üîå
[x] 6.1 Configure Extension Manifest

[x] 6.1.1 Open your extension's manifest.json file.
[x] 6.1.2 Add the trigger URL of your deployed Google Cloud Function to the host_permissions array.
[x] 6.1.3 Ensure the storage permission is included for saving settings and prompts.
[x] 6.2 Update API Service Logic

[x] 6.2.1 Locate the JavaScript file in your extension responsible for making API calls.
[x] 6.2.2 Modify the fetch request to target your Google Cloud Function's URL instead of the direct OpenAI API endpoint.
[x] 6.2.3 Ensure the request body sends the prompt in the format expected by your Cloud Function.
[x] 6.2.4 Remove any logic that handles a locally stored API key for making the OpenAI call.
[x] 6.3 Implement Frontend UI/UX for API Status

[x] 6.3.1 Create a visual indicator in the UI to show the status of the backend connection (e.g., "Connected", "Error").
[x] 6.3.2 Implement robust loading indicators that appear while waiting for a response from the proxy.
[x] 6.3.3 Add user-friendly error handling to display messages if the Cloud Function call fails or returns an error.

- [x] 7.0 Trust Modes and Bulk Processing Features
  - [x] 7.1 Create preview mode component that shows AI-generated response before posting
  - [x] 7.2 Implement trust mode for individual reviews that posts responses directly without preview
  - [x] 7.3 Build bulk processing interface with "Positive Trust Mode" (4-5 star reviews only)
  - [x] 7.4 Implement "Full Trust Mode" bulk processing for all unanswered reviews
  - [x] 7.5 Create rate limiting system with 10-15 second delays between automated responses
  - [x] 7.6 Add bulk operation progress tracking with cancel functionality
  - [x] 7.7 Implement success/error notifications for individual and bulk response posting
  - [x] 7.8 Create confirmation dialogs for bulk operations to prevent accidental mass responses
  - [x] 7.9 Add pause/resume functionality for long-running bulk processing operations
